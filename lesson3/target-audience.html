            <h1>Target Audience Plan</h1>
            <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
                <p>Pretty much everyone needs to know the weather at some point, though the majority of people looking at the weather reports are
                    traveling, trying to protect their homes, or figuring out the best days for activities. This group is usually adults who are in
                    charge of their own schedule/own their property, etc. We want to be able to provide accurate and speedy information so they can
                    prepare in accordance.
                </p>
            <h3>Two Personas (from an actual study):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4/5 people check the weather daily, so there is a huge demand for accurate and fast weather sites.</li>
                    <li>Most people who check daily use their default weather app or a site they've found reliable, while people who don't check daily are more likely to just google it</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>User Scenarios:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Needing to know if their flight will possibly be cancelled due to storms or snow</li>
                    <li>Trying to figure out the best day for a picnic</li>
                    <li>Knowing when or where to travel by car (icy roads, low visibility, likelihood of accidents)</li>
                    <li>Needing to know what clothes to bring to the place where they're going (if moving from one climate to another)</li>
                    <li>What activities to plan for vacation (inside or outside? When and where?)</li>
                    <li>Needing to know if hail or other dangerous storms are coming</li>
                    <li>Possibility of flooding or other house damage</li>
                    <li>In the worst case scenario, do they need to evacuate?</li>
                </ul>
