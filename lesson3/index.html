            <h3>Site Name: Weathering Tomorrow</h3>
            <h4>Domain Name: weatheringtomorrow.com</h4>
                <p>
                    The domain name is available, but I'm not going to spend $12 to buy it for a year. Not sure if there was anything else you needed to know.

            <h3>Site Purpose:</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this site will foremost be to inform people of the coming weather. It should be very easy to navigate and provide weather information for all over the world.
                Being able to select the country/zone of their choice should be easy to do and quick to respond. It could also provide advice on dealing with bad weather, for fun or just as an added bonus.
                Any weather warnings should be 'loud' and clear at the top of the page to help people avoid accidents.
