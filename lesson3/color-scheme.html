            <h3>Color Scheme:</h3>
                <p>
                    Color scheme will be: #001021 #034748 #1481BA #0CAADC #1BC0EE. I chose a blue theme because blue is a very professional color and fits the theme of 'weather' as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fonts will be either black or a dark shade of blue on white, or white on a shade of a dark color.
                    I'm not totally decided on the colors for the background or the final layout because I have to at least
                    draft a wireframe first. It's also subject to changes later on, but I'll likely keep most things the same.
                </p>
